            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>MY deſire is to ſpeak very plainely to you, in a low and common ſtile, that ſo the meaneſt capacity, may receive and underſtand my meaning. You are they that are very near me in my generation, and for viciſſitudes, and perhaps multitudes of times (although, to ſpeak properly, not much time, for our dayes be few and evill) you are to paſſe and ſojourn with me in my pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage: and as my journey drawes towards an end, nearer the grave, the undoubted portion of mortality, ſo your journeys likewiſe become ſhorter, and who knowes the hour of his diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, for our times are in thy hands O God. My accompt is great for you, and my care is great of you (eſpecially for the good of your eternity,) and my commands are therefore great unto you, that with your beſt abilities you aſſiſt me in it, and heartily endeavour to further my good accompt of you in the day of triall: let our great and diligent care be, ſo to ſpend our time, that we may live together (in the true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſervice of our good God) for our eternity: Let us take here comfort in thoſe our friends who are gone, or ſhall go out of this world, before us, <hi>[prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsi non anuſsi,]</hi> who lived and died in the ſame faith and belief with us, and whoſe lives (as we may judge) have anſwered their profeſſion, that we (in the eternall mercy of the eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſt Jeſus) ſhall upon our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, meet them again, <hi>Rev</hi> c. 2. (we being as they were, conſtant in all good duties to the end) and never part one from the other, nor from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſervice of our Creator for ever: This may be (in ſome part) our hope and joy; but our great rejoycing muſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96319:4"/>alwaies be, willingly and joyfully to ſubmit to the will of God, and to his pleaſure for ever. This is not to be the work of a day, but of all the dayes of all our lives; for a day ſoon paſſeth away, and mortality is alwaies at hand; therefore beware of unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſſe, for if the tree fall ill, ſo it lies; upon this moment (as it were) dependeth eternity; if then thou haſt not oyl in thy lampe the door of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is for ever ſhut; and who knows what a day may bring forth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeriouſly conſider, fill your holy lampes with the burning oyl of piety and watch. And know, in caſe any of you become a Parent, that you owe unto your Children, not only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall ſubſiſtence for their bodies, but much more to contribute ſpirituall things unto their better part their ſouls: and be ſure you principle them aright in the beginning of their daies, ſo ſoon as they can doe or apprehend any thing, let it be good; and from the true principle of loving and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our good God, even for his own ſake, which will conduct us to the right loving of our neighbour. I humbly bleſſe our good God, that hath endued all of you with capacities and naturall endowments, in ſome meaſure capable of the beſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: and withall I humbly crave his powerfull ſpirit upon your wills to improve them, and I truſt your beſt compliances ſhall not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Be ſure you imbrace and hold faſt true love one towards another; and although you had ſeverall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet let your love and unity be one, in faith and truth; and the One eternall God will undoubtedly give you the incomprehenſible bleſſing both of temporall and eternall peace: and will ſtrongly fortifie you againſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96319:5"/>any dejection at the deprive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any temporall bleſſings, whileſt you truly conſider the uncertainty of them, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in well uſing of them, and the danger if abuſed: and that nothing is worthy our ſerious thoughts, but what accompanies us to our eternall habitation, and goeth with us to that admirable, perfect and happy eſtate we ſhall moſt certainly arrive unto, if we wean our ſelves from theſe worldly impediments that here deface and clogge our ſouls, and only endeavour and eſteem that good which tends to the good of our eternity. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward endowments of the minde are by far more excellent than the outward adornments of the body; therefore let the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome and foundation of all thy endeavours be laid in pure and undefiled religion, truly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the ſacred Scriptures rightly underſtood <hi>[Sint caſt a deliciae meae ſcripturae tuae, nec faller in eis, O Deus meus, nec fallam ex eis.</hi> Auguſt. Confeſſ.] For except the Lord build the houſe the workmen labour but in vain. We muſt all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and beleeve a moſt ſacred heavenly Deity; for whoſoever come to almighty God aright, fitting for his mercifull and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving acceptance, muſt firſt know and beleeve that he is, and that he is the rewarder of them that ſerve him True religion conſiſteth in the knowledge of God and of our ſelves, (for it is a relative action between both,) the office thereof is, to extoll God to the utmoſt of our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96319:5"/>power, and to beat down man as utterly loſt, and then to furniſh him with means to riſe again; to make him feel his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and his weakneſſe, to the end he may put his whole confidence in God alone. Religion ſhould knit and unite us to the author and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſe of our good, and re-unite us to our firſt cauſe and root, where, if we continue firm, we are thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in our perfection: and contray, if we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we inſtantly faint and languiſh: True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth make us give all honour to almighty God, and receive all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to our ſelves. Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be to God on high, and peace with men on earth. Almighty God muſt be ſerved with our hearts and ſpirits; it is the ſervice anſwerable to his nature, he is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then worſhip him in purity of ſpirit, this he requireth and it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him; the Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth ſuch worſhippers: the moſt acceptable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto his ſacred Majeſty, is a pure, free and humble heart, this he will not deſpiſe: A pure heart is a ſacrifice to God, an innocent ſoul, an innocent life. A holy man is a true ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, his body is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96319:6"/>his Temple, his ſoul is his a Image, his affections are his b offrings, his ſolemne ſacrifice is to imitate, ſerve and implore him. God is rich, and therefore giveth unto us poor, and therefore aske. Although all true worſhip be from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpirit, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we muſt not contemn or diſdain outward and publick ſervice, which muſt be an aſſiſtant to the inward truth, by obſerving ceremonies, orders and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, with moderation, without vanity, ambition, hypocriſie or covetouſnes, as they may and doe tend to the advancement of true devotion in us; alwaies remembring, that God will be ſerved in ſpirit, and what is performed by us otherwiſe, is rather for our ſelves then for God; for humane reſpects and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall obſervances, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine verity, which rather belongs to manners and cuſtoms then the thing it ſelf. Our vowes and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to almighty God ſhould be alwaies with this ſubmiſſion; Thy will be done O Lord, and not mine: [<hi>Tua voluntas Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne mea ſit, &amp; mea voluntas tuam ſemper ſequatur, &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timè ci concordet,</hi> ſaith a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ancient Father.] Take great heed of asking any thing againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of his revealed will: his will is that we
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96319:6"/>ought to fit our ſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. We muſt think, ſpeak and deal with almighty God, as if all the world did behold us, and live and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the world, as if God did behold us. We muſt take great care, not (upon any ſlight occaſion, or curſorily) to uſe the moſt ſacred Name of God, but with premeditation, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently and reverently to ſpeak and uſe it; his Name is holy, and all honour is for ever due unto it. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence being well learned by us, doth admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſufficient upholding comfort in all the chances and changes of this life: We are moſt thankfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and ſubmit to this providence, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth all things to the beſt, to them that truly and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently acknowledge it, without which a Sparrow falls not, and with whom our hairs are numbred: this is the ſtaff of life, the bleſſed ſtay of comfort, on which we ſafely reſt in all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of our pilgrimage: this inward ſpirit works quite contrary to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, it makes us tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, Thy will be done (O God) and not mine; and not only ſay ſo, but hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and thankfully rejoyce that ſo it is, knowing that it is beſt and only good for us: this clears thy ſoul of grief and trouble, and fills thy heart with joy and gladnes;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96319:7"/>knowing that is done which is only good for thee, and that thy will is not done; for had it been againſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, it would have produced thy utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and deſtruction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for ever bleſſe that moſt gracious providence that hath avoided it. Be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to finde out the good of neceſſity, it is a ſweet herbe, but growes not in every garden: it is an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall branch of true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and teacheth to take every thing by the right end; the righteous and the wicked, the wiſe and the fooliſh, the true contented and diſcontented, doe all the ſame things, but not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner, not with the ſame apprehenſion, underſtanding and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither intending or conducing to the ſame end and purpoſe, and therefore the operation in them is not the ſame, but quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Nothing in this world is perfect, therefore there is both good and evill, a right and a wrong uſe of them, the firſt tending to true joy and comfort, the latter to ſorrow and diſcontent. Correction (upon ſearch) diſcovereth ſinne, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to repentance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Not to rejoyce (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerious thoughts) at the chaſtiſements of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is a very evill ſigne of a wicked heart: we muſt be truly ſorrowfull for ſinne
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96319:7"/>which is the only cauſe of correction, not for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; for the cauſe of the diſeaſe, not for the cure. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was corrected I went aſtray, but now have I learned thy word.</hi> O bleſſed and ſweet correction, that leads and holds us in the way to eternall happineſſe: if cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection bring thee not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, with reſolution (by the gracious aſſiſtance of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God) and joy in amendment, ſearch nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly thy wayes, for it is greatly to be feared, they lead thee to eternall death. Correction is the ſweet beams of Gods love to ſoften us, that ſo we may receive the marks of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy: take great heed thou be not as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the Flower, that gathereth poiſon, nor as clay to the Sunne, which is hardened by it: but be thou as wax ſoftned and fitted for impreſſion; and as the Bee, that gathereth honey from the Flower. I adviſe you to labour much in the Scriptures, eſpecially be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perfect in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, they are the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of life, and in them rightly underſtood, is ſalve for every ſore, and ſound counſell in all occaſions. Labour to be a good text-man, for Scripture inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it ſelf, although in ſome places there ſeems li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall contradiction, yet the holy Spirit trieth all, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96319:8"/>findes all, holy, right and good, tending to the all and only good, our temporall and eternall peace, which cannot be taken from us. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>The Lyons ſhall want and ſuffer hunger, but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any thing that is good;</hi> that is to ſay, they ſhall have all good, ſpirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, including in this word good, all ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things as may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation (for whatſoever is contrary thereto, is neither good nor profitable, but bad and pernitious) and therefore God doth not give tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall felicity to all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but only to ſuch of them as he knowes (with the help of his grace) will uſe it well to his honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to ſuch it is a furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſalvation; whereas to wicked men, though it be alſo Gods gift, yet it is not properly counted Gods gift to them, but evill and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; not a bleſſing but a curſe, not felicity but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, by reaſon that it makes them more inſolent, proud and licentious, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence increaſeth their damnation: this is the plain meaning of the Pſalmiſt, and accordingly will one Scripture interpret another. Again <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſire of thine heart.</hi> What is that think you? plenty, credit, vain
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96319:8"/>honour, eaſe, full tables, riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No, no, but that in the want or fullneſſe of theſe things you ſhall reſt in God, and therein have your full deſire, that your will being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the will of God; you ſhall deſire nothing but what is ſutable to his will and pleaſure, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoyce in your will, that the will of God is done, which is only good, and the beſt for you. Search not too curiouſly into Gods Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and myſteries, leſt thou be oppreſſed with the glory of them. Take great heed of infecting thy judgment with falſe doctrine, be alwaies moſt humble in the ſight of God, and offer unto him the chaſtity of an inward minde. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe from good works during life, but lay up the treaſure of all thy love in heaven, and be aſſured that for thy well doing, thou ſhalt have thy reward of true joy and peace in minde and conſcience in this life, as a heavenly gift (when earth perhaps denies thee any) and perfect peace for thy eternity: and further know, that who doth a work never ſo good and laudable in it ſelf, if he doe it to gain the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the world, more then out of duty and obedience to almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, he ſhall have his reward, that is perhaps the vain-glory he looked for, a worldly reward, but not my reward, that is, the moſt bleſſed and glorious reward of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, a heavenly reward, which he hath laid up eternally for his bleſſed Saints and ſervants in heaven. My wiſhes to you are, that you will every one of you ſeriouſly obſerve my drift herein; and that you will not only read and practiſe it, in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96319:9"/>beſt conſtruction for your ſouls good, but that you will teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo to doe, eſpecially your Children, if God ſhall give you any; and to this joyn hearing, reading, prayer, meditation, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alms and charity, and all other Chriſtian duties, in true love to almighty God for his own ſake, to your neighbours for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements ſake, and both for obedience ſake unto his ſacred Majeſty. Conſider, that as one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration goeth, ſo another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and it ſhall be only well to the righteous; be righteous then and our good God will ſurely bleſſe you, and in the beſt time of his providence will bring us all together to eternall peace in Chriſt Jeſus. Children I do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you to ſtudy, read or love this book above others (by far more learned Authors) becauſe of any oratory, wit or learning there is ſhewed in it; but becauſe in its right conſtruction (I truſt) it is pious, true and honeſt; and comes from a near related heart, that truly deſires and hopes (in the ſweet and ſaving mercy of our good God) to live with you all in the eternall and perfect welfare of your ſouls and bodies, when our ſhort, dangerous and various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned pilgrimages in this world are ended; and that truly endeavours and deſires the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect welfare of your ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the true converſion of both into the ſincere love of our Creatour, more then all the world beſides: therefore ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, and the Lord give you perfect wiſdom from heaven in all things. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>INfancy the firſt Age, is like paſſing through the red Sea, in this is required patience, this is our firſt footing into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to which we paſſe through the bloudy ſea of our diſtreſſed mother; afflicting her with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that firſt tells us of a land of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96319:11"/>reſt. And why ſhould nature thus behave her ſelf, to ſeem ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to her deareſt nurce, and Viper-like, to kill and tear her damme? it may be this, becauſe there is a dangerous wilderneſſe to paſſe through, before we come to this Land of Promiſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by-wayes and broad pathes in it leading all to deſtruction, and only one ſtrait way and narrow path there is that leadeth to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and hard it is, and few there are that finde it: and being once ſet down in this wandring deſert, if we miſſe this ſtrait way, and goe a deadly path, woe is to us that ever we undertook it, better had it been for us if we had not been born. But as the loſſe is moſt ſad, ſo is the right ordering of our way, and following this ſtrait path, moſt joyfull in the end: for what are afflictions, if through them we enter into the Kingdom of God, of which the momentany afflictions of this life are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; and unleſſe we undertake this journey, unleſſe we runne, we cannot obtain, we cannot have the prize, the bliſſe. This is the day of ſmall things, the beginning of dayes unto us, the beginning of our pretious time, ſo ſwift a ſteed, that if he once paſſe we cannot bring him back; therefore let us improve the time becauſe the dayes are evill, be very vigilant that it paſſe not in vain. Some times there are, which are taken from us; ſome are ſtollen from us; and others ſlip away from us; but the ſhamefulleſt loſſe of time that may be, is when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from our own negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. We ſee a great part of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96319:11"/>time flitteth from all men, very much from idle perſons, and the whole from thoſe that love ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; therefore ought we to put a great price upon time, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of a day, and to know that we dye daily; for herein are we deceived, becauſe we ſuppoſe death to be far from us, when the truth is, death holds all our years in his poſſeſſion, therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and lay hold on every houre. So ſhalt thou be bleſſed in ſuſpence for to morrow, if thou faſten thy hands on to day; whileſt life is deferred it fleeteth, therefore make good uſe of time while thou haſt it, for infinite are the waies that end it to thee. It is a very evill thing, to delay the performing of good duties in this life, which is very ſhort, if thou wouldeſt fortifie &amp; provide againſt the purſuite of a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemy, then more eſpecially againſt the power of death, it is more worthy to conſummate life, before death, then to delay the living of a bleſſed life, and death take us unprepared, the greateſt loſſe is the loſſe of time, and the greateſt grief, when it is truly conſidered. A good life conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in the ſpace, but uſe of time, whence it cometh to paſſe, that he who hath lived longeſt hath often lived little, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. As the heathen Philoſopher wiſely obſerved of one, who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the improvement of his time, <hi>Quod octoginta Annorum fuit, ſeptem tamen Annos tantum vixit;</hi> accounting only that life, which was ſpent with prudence and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection. Conſider when thou lyeſt down, it may be thou
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96319:12"/>ſhalt not riſe, when thou ſleepeſt, thou mayeſt not awake, and when thou wakeſt thou mayſt ſleep no more: <hi>Ut ſomnus mori is, ſic lectus imago ſepulchri.</hi> When thou goeſt forth thou maiſt not returne, and when thou returneſt, thou maiſt goe forth no more, there is not three fingers only betwixt the Mariner and death, but in all places, and at all times, death and life are not farre aſunder; every where death ſhews not himſelf ſo nigh, as nigh he is: but live thou the life of the righteous, and thou ſhalt ſurely die the death of the righteous, which is the ſure gain of eternall life in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

In this Age we are to proceed in thoſe little foot-ſteps of learning, which probably (if not much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected) hath been laid out to us in the former Age. Foundations ought to be of the moſt laſting materials, becauſe if they fail, the whole building is in danger, and they are moſt hard and unuſuall to be removed; therefore let thy firſt learning be the beſt, and that is thy duty to thy Maker, which comprehendeth the generall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all duty: Learn di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precepts, eſpecially the old and new Teſtament, that may
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96319:14"/>make thee wiſe to ſalvation, and that will by Gods mercy bring on a delight in prayer, in reading and hearing the Word of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Inſtruct a childe while he is young, and he will remember it afterwards: Never teach a childe that which is evill, which he muſt either leave, or be untaught; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft brotherly love one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ever rejoycing in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers welfare, but eſpecially in the good of your eternity. Now thou muſt begin to take ſome notice of paſſages, and accidents, that doe, may, or have befallen thee, or ſome near thee; eſpecially of the death and mortality of thy friend or acquaintance; for often to think of death, is a great means to be well prepared for it: and taking notice of paſſages and caſualty in others, fits us for changes and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations that muſt befall our ſelves. About this time it is, that corrupted youth begins to make excuſe for faults, but doe thou fly the faults and it is ſufficient. Strive to know good from evill, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the good, and be ſure to avoid all appearances of evill: he hardly recovers health, that knowes not he is ſick: if we begin not our cure betime, when ſhall we caſt off thoſe many plagues and ſickneſſes that begirt us. A Chriſtian muſt be an expert Spirituall Souldier, and therefore muſt learn betime to put on his whole armour of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: we muſt begin to reform and correct our mindes, before they be confirmed in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and corruption: corrupted nature proffers no man a good minde before an evill, therefore is the minde to be enforced, ſo ſhall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96319:14"/>the medicine prove ſweet while it cureth. Of other remedies there are certain pleaſures after health: Divinity is both wholeſome and pleaſing; it is very neceſſary that Tutors and teachers of Children, and all that company with them be religiouſly diſpoſed, gentle and peaceable; example, in this age eſpecially, prevailes much beyond precept; that which is tender lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hold on that which is near unto it, growes with it, and is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned to it: Nurces and Maſters are often imitated by Children, and more oft in their vices then vertues, by how much in humane things the bad exceeds the good; therefore timely and diligent heed muſt be prepared againſt them, that ſo the Cokatrice and ſubtill Serpent may be killed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, broken in the egg, before it ſhew a deceitfull countenance; leſt the diſſembling Wolfe, having gotten a Sheeps cloathing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the innocent Lambs, and bring them unawares into his ſlaughterhouſe of deſtruction.</p>

Vertue is that which properly belongs to a wiſe man, and cannot be taken from him, bloudy Tyrants have no power over this; thoſe goods are true and only worthy our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious endeavours to obtain, which cannot be taken from us; as for riches, honour, precious-ſtones, gold, ſilver, epicures feaſts and ſuch like, they are but earthly burdens, which a ſincere minde, and ſuch as is not forgetfull of his nature cannot love, becauſe nature ſpiritualized is alwayes light, and will mount as high as heaven as ſoon as it ſees the gate open; in the mean while (as farre as theſe bonds of the body, and maſſe of the fleſh which environeth the ſame will permit) upon the wings of a ſudden and ſwift thought, it viſiteth and vieweth celeſtiall things, and examineth both time paſt and that which is to come; whereas this frail body, the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and gives of the ſoul, is toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hither and thither, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thefts, and ſickneſſes are exerciſed upon it; but a vertuous minde is ſacred and eternall, and wicked hands cannot lay hold to hurt it. Endeavour to obtain, and keep thy ſelf very cloſe to all kinde of Vertue which the holy Spirit ſhall upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion dart into thy minde, and take great heed thou quench not the holy Spirit in thee, by ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neglecting, refuſing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying to make good uſe of the good motions thereof; for (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

The firſt is Wiſdome, which teaches all duty to thy Maker, thy ſelf, and thy neighbour; this is a principall thing, <hi>therefore get wiſdome, and above all thy get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings get underſtanding;</hi> then get Patience which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereth the world, and fits thee to receive all the ſweet corrections of thy Maker with joy and comfort; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the patience of <hi>Job,</hi> and the ſweet and pleaſant fruits thereof. Then get Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, whereby thy body and minde will be a fit Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle for the holy Ghoſt to dwell in, and in the power of the holy Spirit ſubdue natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Law and rules of true piety and religion. Next Meekneſſe: <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meekeſt man upon the earth (ſaith the Text <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.3.

Then Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and watchfullneſſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially over thy ſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhew thy true fortitude and valour, in conquering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling thy naturall paſſions, ſubjecting them to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right rules of reaſon and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; here is great uſe and need of temperance, leſt heady and ſelf-conceited youth, think and preſume to run before he can goe; Temperance gives a ſweet relliſh and ſeaſoning to all the vertues: and it is perpetually required in controverſies and conteſtations, trouble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, this vertue bridles plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant things that deceive the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and by ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion takes the good of things obdurate.

The minde is the moſt excellent part of a man, prudence and humility is an eſpeciall guide to it; by the minde are actions tried, as we there relliſh, ſo are our attempts, how needfull then is the guide of perfect reaſon; it is the hand that guides the minde, to promote and allow thoſe things only which are honeſt, good and profitable, and abhor and avoid the contrary: it is the light of the Lord unto us, whereby we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern good and evill, it's that which names us men, and only maks us dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the beaſts. Our good is ſaid to be conſummate, if we have fulfilled that to which we were born, which is true reaſon, ſufficient not only to foreſee, but to execute an action. Take great heed to avoid all the enemies to this ſure guide, among the reſt avoid anger; for what is more fooliſh, then that reaſon

Is it wiſdome onely that makes us differ from beaſts, and is it our beſt guide to the well ordering of our lives? then let us inquire into the properties of this wiſdome, that ſo we may adorn our ſelves therewith: Some will have it that a wiſe man can receive no wrong (as to himſelf) for by his patience, and right underſtanding of the end of all conditions, the evill reſts upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and actor of it: Alſo wiſe men only know to whom to give, and how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the benefits, and are very much content with their ſerious thoughts and meditations, and do not permit external things to adde or detract much from them. The company and advice of wiſe men is very profitable, for that they are not ſubject to motion of anger, neither can they be moved with diſorder, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themſelves with miſeries, and in condemning others faults, they alwaies begin with their own: as for outward riches, they uſe them as ſervants, but fools uſe them as commanders. Some have conceived, that evill in it ſelf is only evill to him that offereth it, that which offendeth ought to have more force then that which is offended, but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96319:20"/>vice hath not more force then vertue, whereupon it followeth, that wiſe men cannot be offended; they are patient and apply all things to the beſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, brideling their paſſions, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all evill otherwaies then the paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and converting all to good: Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeeks no revenge, for that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongs to God; <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, ſaith the Lord;</hi> from whoſe forbearance and long-ſuffering we may learn patience: wherefore to avoid ſtrife, is a remedy againſt much trouble, and it is a true point of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to be prepared againſt all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of evill with conſtancy: to that end betake thy ſelf to ſome honeſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, for thou ſhalt finde it moſt neceſſary and beneficiall unto thee, to ſpend thy time in ſome honeſt calling, which muſt by no means hinder thy conſtant devotion and meditation. All callings may be abuſed, and a man may be wicked and violate his ſoul, or he may be upright, in any of them: but of all, I only adviſe from a ſoul hers life, wherein me thinks the ſoul is made ſubject to the body, which is the ready way of ruine to them both; for that a man doth binde himſelf to kill his neighbour at every order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of another, without examination or knowledge of the cauſe or matter; wherefore (as for other irreligious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancies almoſt wholly overſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that profeſſion) I eſteem it a calling moſt ſubject to temptations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpiritually dangerous, if not with moſt ſerious care performed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.14. Wherein I doe not condemn or wholly diſallow in any caſe the taking up of Arms, but I counſell and adviſe that it be not undertaken without moſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care and circumſpection, which may (by the mercy of the God of hoſts) obtain his bleſſed guidance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96319:20"/>and preſervation from thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold dangerous allurements and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations incident to that imployment, which ſtrongly preſſe to the diſtraction of the ſoul, with which the body muſt participate. Time is a root that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brings forth many branches, many caſualties and changes it doth produce to all mortality, and nothing befits a man better to entertain ſuch paſſages, then ſuch a calling and imployment, as when evill preſents it ſelf to us, we may have ready at hand honeſt and juſt actions, to aſſiſt pious and holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, from which we (by the gracious mercy of God) ſhall receive much comfort, and never be aſhamed; whereas idleneſſe and want of good and honeſt action is a root for any evill.</p>

Secondly, let not money, beauty, or friends, be the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to thy choice, for theſe things all fade, and ſo thy due af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection may alſo fail, but chooſe ſuch a one as may cheerfully walk with thee, in Chriſt to Chriſt, and in that walk thou maiſt finde a true and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refreſhment. Thirdly, be very circumſpect how thou marrieſt one that before was married, it may doe well, but I can give no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it, for it ſeemes as good for thee to make thy partner, as for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to make thy houſe, whereby we commonly avoid great loſſe, but alwaies great hazard. Fourthly, it is good to chooſe equality in paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and proportion, in ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable meaſure; and if greater then thy proportion in theſe, be offered, ſearch narrowly leaſt there be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96319:23"/>in the graſs, leaſt theſe adorne the Owner, and not the Owner theſe. Fiftly, endeavour thy living in ſome wholeſome ayre, where (by the bleſſing of God) thou maiſt probably have health in thy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Sixtly, let thy partner be of a ſtrong and healthy habit of body, for that a ſickly conſtitution en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangereth the loſſe both of eſtate and affection. Seventhly, having made thy choice, and providence having therin determined and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his appointment, do thou as the admired Bee, that takes honey out of ſower herbs, and let nothing be ſo bitter to thee, that thou ſhouldeſt not convert it to ſome good uſe, moving thee to true Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and do thou joyfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thy ſelf in all the providences of God towards thee, eſpecially when thou ſeeſt his pleaſure ſo fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and concluded, hate all deſire to change, increaſe, and nouriſh all good honeſt, and contented inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and beſure to ſubdue, hate, and and avoide all appearances of evill; murmuring or diſlike of thy choice, and know that we are all here, but in our journey, the way of our pilgrymage, which ſoe it leade to Heaven, happy is that paſſage: for the ſeas are rough through which we muſt ſaile to eternall Peace, or not attaine it. Now a word or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning chaſtity or continency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is very difficult; and muſt have a carefull and painefull guard, for it is no eaſie matter wholly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt nature, which herein is ſtrong and ardent, but the more obſtinate the enemy, the more commendable the conqueſt. To be truely chaſt out of due obedience to the commands of God, is alike Vertue laudable in men as women: Now becauſe this is a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96319:23"/>violent paſſion and deceitfull, we muſt arm our ſelves againſt it, and be wary to diſcover its baits, and the more it flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, the more to diſtruſt it, it would willingly imbrace us to ſtrangle us, pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per us with honey to glut us with gall. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt incontinency hath many great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies and dangers; it conſumes the body, and (as ſome ſay) effeminates the ſoul, weakens the ſpirit, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by giving way thereto, have loſt both lives, fortunes and ſpirits; and it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear true, that there is more pleaſure in vanquiſhing pleaſure, then in poſſeſſing it; the beſt of earthly things oft breeds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but the worſt alwayes. There are many kindes and degrees of chaſtity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency and incontinency, of which the conjugall continency is a chief and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, it muſt be kept and retained within the chaſt breaſt of that party whom almighty God hath diſpoſed of in marriage for our companion, and whoſoever doth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, violates his or her own body, by the Law of God which commands chaſtity therein, by the Law of nature, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids that to be common which is proper to one, and impoſes upon faith and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by the Law of nations, and by the Law of Juſtice, equity and right, which if we violate and offend, the juſtice of heaven muſt juſtly puniſh us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and adulterers, God will judge.</hi>

                  <p>NOw we have by the mercy of God obtained a fruitfull plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in this promiſed Land, let us plant in it good and wholeſome fruit, for <hi>men do not gather grapes of thorns nor figgs of thiſtles.</hi> Here we may proceed in the ſixth Age of our Life, and third aſcent of our Manhood, under the notion of conſtant Action, and hereby our duty is, by all means to endeavour the good of all: the heavens lead us to this by ſhining upon all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes of gain or requitall: ſhewing thereby the duty of a good man to his neighbour; to be conſtantly converſant in ſome good employment of the body, minde or both, is a very lively branch of true vertue, which keeps a man unvanquiſhed, and is not ſubject to pleaſures, and hath its reward in it ſelf: Vertue doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone bring forth ſolid joy, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enables a man to bear all the changes and chances of this life with comfort; and doe you right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider all the branches that proceed from this root, and you will finde that they are firmly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with linkes unſeparable; as all the branches of a tree have but one root to nouriſh them, ſo all the Vertues have but one principall foundation, which is the doing all things out of true obedience to the ſervice and commands of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, therefore is true Vertue moſt highly to be aſpired unto. Wiſdome is a true branch of it, which makes a man rightly to underſtand, the nature, uſe and property of all things, and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing evill but vice, which it is alwaies ſufficiently fortified againſt, and cannot enter there

                  <p>Now thou haſt (by Gods gracious aſſiſtance) obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a good plantation, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, there muſt be a time of weeding, nouriſhing and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, that ſo we may know the beſt way to improve our Talent in our heavenly Maſters ſervice: In this time (which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Age of a man) is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fortitude, gravity and ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, a ſtayedneſſe, and ſerious conſideration of all our underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, a wiſe take-heed and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into the event of a buſineſſe. Paſt and preſent things every man declares, but ſolid wiſdome on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhewes the event of things to come; which although it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times faile (becauſe the eternall God hath ſo decreed, that man ſhould not know what ſhould be after him) yet to us it is the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Lord, and being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, it is a glimmering of the heavenly light, and excelleth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unadviſedneſſe, as light excelleth darkneſſe. To what purpoſe doth he plant that doth not well preſerve, but ſuffers ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Bores to root and ſpoyl: and who ſo vain as he that builds a houſe, and doth not well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and keep the ſame? The very microcoſme of our body, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to have a fore ſight into our affairs and dealings; for we have two Ears to receive dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by, and two Eyes to look before us, whereas of other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers we have but one where the uſe is more ſingle. I adviſe thee to determine of nothing in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if anger be at all allowed it muſt be without ſinne; <hi>Be angry but ſinne not:</hi> and then
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96319:28"/>ſurely it muſt be very ſhort, the Sunne muſt not goe down upon it. Anger is a high degree of madneſſe, and therefore unfits a man wholly to act any buſineſſe in it: it is only good when with thy ſelf for the committing of ſinne, from which there is ſome hopes of thy repentance, with care for the future to avoid it. Anger unfits a man either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf or offend his enemy, it doth diſarm us as it were, and lay us open to all attempts againſt us, therefore have a ſpeciall care to govern thy paſſions, and keep thy ſelf in a conſtant ſetled way in thy affections, that ſo no chance or accident may attempt thee unprovided, or unfortified with ſtrong reaſon and wiſdome to oppoſe and reſiſt it: paſſion ſets a falſe gloſſe upon a buſineſſe, and maketh him ſeem guilty, whom moderation and perfect reaſon would clearly excuſe. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur not, neither be angry at any affliction in this life, but bleſſe almighty God that it is no ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto thee, conſidering the great deſerts of thy infinite tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions: remember (if thou make right uſe of it) that it is a ſign and mark of the love of God to thee, and be thou truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, humble and thankfull for it; for why ſhould a ſinfull man complaine of a man for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his ſinnes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all humble obedience, love and thankfullneſſe, lift up thy heart with thy hands unto God in the heavens. That thou mayeſt avoid the occaſion of much anger and paſſion, ſet a watch over thy lips, and a ſtrict reſtraint to thy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96319:28"/>tongue; uſe not many words, for that can hardly be without ſinne; eſpecially take heed of curſing, ſwearing, blaſpheming, lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and love not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late fabulous and vain jeſts, for they are commonly as near a lye as complements to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and diſſimulation, which is a gilded untruth to make it paſſe the better. Two things (its ſaid) never wax old in a man, which (without a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full watch) draw the whole body into ſinne, that is the heart and the tongue, the heart alwayes imagining new things, and the tongue is ſwift to utter them: eſpecially whilſt thou art young keep much ſilence, for that will prevent much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: impriſon thy tongue or it will impriſon thee; ſet a reſtraint unto it, for it may be an evill enemy to thee. Some ſay a lyar is only good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale ſecrets unto, for that no man that knowes him will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve his relation. Some ſay, he which knowes not how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble knowes not how to live, but diſſembling then muſt be taken only for not ſpeaking all the truth at all times, which in ſome ſenſe may be eſteemed diſſembling, but I conceive a man may ſo diſſemble without blame if he wiſely order his diſcourſe: whatſoever thou ſayeſt or doeſt, perform it from a pure and right principle, in true performance of filiall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſo highly due unto our God, and not out of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to man, other then in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting in thy neighbour all
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96319:29"/>good, and preventing in him any appearance of evill, that by thy evill example thou be not acceſſory to thy neighbours ſinne. Now to ſpeak a little of fortitude, which is a rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and produceth much wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy praiſe and commendation, if rightly uſed, but may be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (as other good vertues) to much loſſe and dammage: its ſaid of Prudence and Juſtice, that they govern a man in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but Fortitude and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance govern a man in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and alone: All accidents in this life may be comprehended under proſperity and adverſity, the former guideth in adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the latter in proſperity, and theſe two vertues may wholly be compriſed and underſtood by this word Conſtancy, which is a right and equall ſtayedneſſe of minde in all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and outward things, whereby he is not puffed up in proſperity, nor dejected in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity: Now Fortitude or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in the generall and vulgar underſtanding of the words, is exerciſed wholly in oppoſition and in ſubduing all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, contemning all terrible things, and (if abuſed) brings faire liberty into bondage. Military valour is commonly much different from true for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: we finde this valour in the ordinary ſenſe common in beaſts, but true Fortitude is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found in Wiſdome; many attain Valour by uſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, example or cuſtome, though they be of baſe and ſlaviſh mindes, without any
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96319:29"/>tincture of vertue or true for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which is farre from an inconſiderate temerity or brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſtupidity, for vertue cannot be without knowledge, and true fortitude is a ſtayed minde grounded upon the duty, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and juſtice of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, which never ceaſeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it overcome, for that it is a quality of the minde not of the body, not of the limbes, but of true courage in the heart and will, whereby it is truly ſound; for not the conflict but the cauſe ſheweth valour, in which much wiſdome and diſcretion muſt be ſhewed in the execution, and all lawfull meanes uſed to avoid an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger: true forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is both a director and a protector, therefore moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be obtained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it coſt both pay and pains.</p>

The ear is a principall agent to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and by the well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, ſaving faith is obtained; ſpeech is the meſſenger of the heart, and interpreter of the ſoul, and is chiefly ordained to edifie and inſtruct to ſalvation, it doth diſcover our mentall ſecrets, and men judge very much by it: One ſaid well, Speak that I may ſee thee, that is, know thy heart; like golden Apples in pictures of ſilver, ſo are words ſpoken in due ſeaſon: But becauſe our duty is in all our waies to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant watch over our ſelves, we will endeavour to mention ſome few more of thoſe particulars we are to watch over: Firſt, Over all vain, idle and ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and thoughts, they are by nature innumerable in us: Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is a folly and a vanity,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96319:32"/>like catching of ſmoake inſtead of light, the ſhadow inſtead of the body; it is to faſten contentment upon the opinion of the vulgar, voluntarily to renounce ones own liberty, to follow the paſſions of others; to diſpleaſe ones ſelf for the pleaſure of the beholders; to let our own affections depend on the eyes of others; and ſo farre to love vertue as may like the vulgar: to doe good, not for love of good but reputation, this is either to be filled with nothing but winde, or elſe to be empty: Ambition hath no limits, it's a gulf without brink or bottome, fire that increaſeth by it's own nouriſhment: it is it's own pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and excecutioner, and is only juſt in that. True humility is a chief Embleme of honour; the higher the Sunne is, the leſſer ſhadow it maketh: the greater the vertue is, the leſſe glory it ſeeketh. Commonly honour is truly compared to a ſhadow, which follows thoſe that flie it, and flieth thoſe that follow it: Let us receive our charge modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and exerciſe it ſincerely, knowing that almighty God hath placed us to ſtand centinell, that others may reſt in ſafety under our care. Parchment-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or by deſcent onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſert, is ſhamefull and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble: it is greater honour not to have the mark having deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, than to have it: it is more honourable to be asked why thy ſtatue is not ſet up in the market-place, than why it is: it is not the honour commonly given of Princes to their ſubjects (who give it moſt oft to them that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96319:33"/>deſerve it leaſt, and can give that ſhadow neither but upon that little ground, and that little ground, and thoſe few hearts they command; whereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſhame and reproach to thoſe that have it) that almighty God ſeems actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to guide, or very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably to allow; but true wiſdome is true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and thereby we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour aright our neighbour and our God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to attain this wiſdome, ought to be our care and ſtudy. Let thy watch like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe take heed of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and prodigality: to love or affect riches with too much care to get or keep them is covetouſneſſe, for they are not worthy our earneſt care and attention: the deſire of goods, and our pleaſure in them is only opinion, what we neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily uſe not, are a burthen. Covetouſnes is a wrong eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and uſe of riches, it is a paſſion that reſpecteth riches as the principall good of a man, and feareth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty as the greateſt evill; nature hath placed it under us, and we eſteem it above our ſelves; it is ordained to ſupply neceſſity, and we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet it without occaſion: Prodigality is the contrary paſſion, and it is likewiſe very vitious, for in deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or miſuſing the gift, we doe the ſame to the giver: to ſpend prodigally is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the means to doe well,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96319:33"/>to fling away the ſtaff, and then complain becauſe we fall: he that hath the leaſt Talent, hath leaſt burthen, leaſt account; yet take heed for the leaſt muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, and therefore not miſuſed, nor rejected.</p>

Juſtice is to give to every man that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to him, to a mans ſelf firſt, and afterwards to others; ſo that it comprehends all the duty and offices of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular party: Does as thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt (or rather as thou oughteſt) to be done to, carries a man very farre, but not through, or to the utmoſt of this duty: before we can well know how to command others, we muſt know how to command our ſelves, how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelves from our ſelves: reaſon muſt command; the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, deſire and will, muſt all be obedient to it: this is the firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, inward, proper and moſt beautifull juſtice that may be. Equity and right reaſon is true juſtice, which handleth and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Law as need requireth: the Laws and juſtice muſt be handled juſtly, both in rewards and puniſhments: Juſtice cannot be executed by the lump or in groſs, but muſt be drawn out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to particular diſpenſations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96319:34"/>to the occaſion. The two parts and hands of Juſtice, are puniſhment and reward, but as it is uſually miniſtred, it is commonly lame, at leaſt in one of them. Charity begins at home, ſo muſt juſtice; by it we may examine our ſelves, how, and to what end we live and ſpend our dayes; ſurely it muſt not be to paſſe our ſhort and pretious time careleſly, by chance and by adventure, as the moſt doe, who live not ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and attentively (as indeed our duty is) but vainly, heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly from day to day, and as it falleth out: they taſte not, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe not, enjoy not their lives, but uſe them only to make uſe of other things; by this means they abuſe themſelves, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things through their miſuſe: they doe all things (as I may ſay) in good earneſt: but to live: they are ſerious in the leaſt, and in the main and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall they are negligent. We may and ought to live ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, attentively and cheerfully, for that our life is a buſineſſe of great weight and importance, and we muſt give an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof: take heed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring and putting off this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to thy ſelf, reſembling ſuch as deferre buying till the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket be over: how fooliſh is it to begin to live when we muſt ceaſe to live: he that means to doe a great work in a ſhort time, had need to follow it very cloſe, leaſt his time ceaſe before his work be finiſhed, and he faulty, becauſe he took o more time, or loſt ſo much, when indeed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96319:35"/>we need nothing more: Life is ſhort, and the art of well living is long; betimes then learn how to live to God, and to thy ſelf, how to be leaſt alone when no body is with thee: And then be watchfull of vain deluſions and temptations: our great enemy the devill hath deceitfull baits both for lonelineſſe and for company: Contemplation, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, prayer and practiſe, is the happy life, let thy body be ſubject to thy ſpirit, and let thy ſpirit be wholly ſubdued by the Spirit of the Lord, ſo ſhall thy body be a fit inſtrument for vertue, and a holy Temple for thy God. Doe thou juſtice to thy ſelf in getting and ordering riches, love a competency, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them well got into thy houſe, not into thy heart, and ſtrive to uſe them as a juſt ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to thy maſters uſe, that their departure may be as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt as their entrance; if they part without thy leave, let them carry nothing but themſelves from thee, no part of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or comfort, let not that be ſetled on them: the right uſe of the creature, is to walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of thy Creatour: Thus much of juſtice. Now a word or two of ſound Judgment what it is; and it is the ſtrict and wary triall and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every thing to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; it is the examining of a matter, to finde out the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of it, what it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and where the way ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto its period: it is the free and ready acceptance of the truth, where and whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96319:35"/>it appears and ſhewes it ſelf: it is the weighing the reaſons and counter-reaſons on all parts, the weight and merit in them, thereby to work out the truth: And it is contrary to that ſleight and careleſſe way of judging and paſſing by things upon the firſt ſight and appearance, as if we were able to ſee what was in the houſe before we entred in, or what lay under the ſtone, before we remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it: this is that grievous folly which men truly call raſhneſſe and ſelf conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and all wiſe men count it ſhallow, empty, and want of ſound judgment; for juſtice and right it ſelf, being unadviſedly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by chance, without ſound judgment and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the matter, may (as to the Judg) be falſe, or at leaſt undeſerving praiſe and commendation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavour, not only to doe good, but to doe it knowingly, willingly and wittingly, and from a pure and right principle, which ſheweth ſincere and upright wiſdome, and is worthy the righteous title of juſtice and ſound judgment.</p>

            <p>IT's too much (God knowes) the manner of Chriſtians, to owe their Title meerly to the Font, Education or Countrey; their primitive principles much ſatisfying their proceeding devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; whereas Grace and reaſon beſt confirms Chriſtianity; by which we are taught not to hate, but pity thoſe of carnall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted belief, heartily endeavouring their better reformation and inſtruction. Chriſtianity being largely ſpread, and divided, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profeſſors fallen from the native beauty, and true belief thereof; wherefore we muſt be very wary to preſerve and practiſe it in the primitive integrity, which our Saviour and his Apoſtles taught, the holy Fathers and Martyrs have confirmed; and take heed we imitate not the ancient Pagans, contemning a pure truth for a poor profeſſion: I doe not herein diſſwade from a juſt and pious refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, well knowing, it's better to avoid then detain a corrupted principle, in which (the humble and ſincere heart) the Almighty guideth and will deliver from thoſe evils and corruptions, which (I fear) in ſome ſort poſſeſſe both reformations and reformers, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from too much ſelf-inclination or advantage: therefore I take it not unfitly warned from violence or warre, onely for Religion or belief: for whatſoever one hath framed or beleeved, another may likewiſe frame and beleeve: therefore hereſies will ariſe, ſo we reade, but not that they will be quite aboliſhed: there are ſchiſmes and diviſions in all Religions, but a wary combatant may lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable under the true buckler of faith: where reaſon cannot, faith muſt lead the way, which is not only above, but ſometimes againſt it alſo: how neceſſary then is the contemplation of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of the Almighty, his wiſdome, eternity, mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which never admits us to be alone or ſolitary; which is a ſweet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, a conſtant reſt, repoſe and comfort. Reaſon and wiſdome are co-partners, and jewels to be earneſtly ſought for, whereby we learn to read the book of the Creatures,<note place="margin">Natura nihil git fruſtra.</note> and therein to behold the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite bounty of our Creator.</p>

            <p>Naturall actions are much beyond our reaſon, and Man is an epitome and compendium of all the terreſtriall creatures: There are two books that diſcover our Maker to us, <hi>viz.</hi> holy Writ and Nature; thoſe which never heard of one, have diſcovered him in the other: the Almighty very much walketh in the path of reaſon, when otherwiſe, it is a miracle; for nature is (as it were) the Art of God. The abſolute and incomprehenſible providence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, is the diſpoſing of all things, that appoints our heirs, and doth the works faſly aſcribed to Fortune.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed are thoſe praying conqueſts of the objecting doubts in Divinity: the devil will never end thoſe diſputes while we are in his Principality: but while we build up our reaſon, he endeavoureth to pull down our faith: There are ſeverall ſorts of hainous blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but an Atheiſt playes at all, and at once denies there is a God. I beleeve there is many an accepted faith, which cannot endure fire and faggot, and know not but Countries and particular perſons too may have their tutelar and protecting Angels: nor that the Saints departed may not know the paſſages of their friends on earth, for that it is ſaid, at the converſion of a ſinner the Angels of Heaven rejoyce; for being that man is not only in the bulk and lump of the creatures, but lives the life of plants, animals and ſpirits, it is a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96319:46"/>mighty priviledge and favour from our Creatour, and may be a hierogliphyck of ſupernaturall knowledge. The miſtery of the Creation is very great, but more particularly of man: at the bare word the creatures were made of nothing, but man was firſt made of earth, and afterward the Image of his Maker by more ſacred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: therefore he muſt not doate of life, nor fear to die; for to be too ſenſible of life, and hopeleſſe of death becomes no man, much leſſe a Chriſtian: for although death ſoon layes our honour in the duſt, and changes us from commanding men, into ſubmiſſion to the beaſts, yet we (that is our ſouls) are immortall, and (if not our own faults) not ſubject to ſo vile allotment. I cannot finde life worth the wiſh, unleſſe thereby we may ſerve our Maker, and therein profit or promore our bleſſed eternity: but if our ſinnes grow numerous with our hours, and ſo outgrow our deſpiſed repentance, where is then that profit of our many years? therefore it is, that there is a ſecret end, and bottom of our dayes, his wiſdome hath determined them: his waking providence doth fulfill them, wherein the ſpirits, our ſelves, and all the creatures of the Almighty, in a ſecret and undiſputed way, perform his pleaſure: Another hand twines the thread of life, than that of nature,</p>

            <p>To avoid death, in a miſerable life, is Chriſtian fortitude: it is a very great bleſſing, that although the weakeſt hand may take away our life, yet the ſtrongeſt cannot deprive us of death: for ſeeing this corrupted life cannot be without ſinne, happy is death that puts an end to it: the devill therein was deceived; for that his envy in bringing us into ſinne, hath (by the Almighty mercy) likewiſe brought upon us naturall death, whereby we are freed and ſecured both from him and it. Now our certain and eternall habitations, are thoſe incomprehenſible ſcituations, Heaven and Hell, which none define or tell what and where they are, a negative is the beſt we have; <hi>bye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard nor can mans heart conceive:</hi> but Heaven, may be, the ſatisfaction to the ſoul, wherein it deſires neither addition nor alteration: and the unſatisfied knowing appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite after vanity, may be ſaid a hell: therefore let us fear the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, but not be afraid of ſhine; let rather his mercies make us aſhamed of our ſinnes, then his judgements afraid thereof. I think few are ſcared into Heaven, they goe the faireſt way that would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96319:46"/>ſerve the Almighty without a Hell: thoſe mercenaries that crouch unto him for fear of Hell, though they terme themſelves the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, are indeed, but the ſlaves of the Almighty. The ſeverall afflictions of the Saints are improved, and doe prove the ſecret fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Almighty: it is a ſingular piece of wiſdome, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the juſtice of the Almighty from his mercy, and not miſcall thoſe his mighty attributes, who is mercifull to all, and better to the worſt then the beſt deſerve, the moſt perfect actions on earth having no title or claim to Heaven, for while we keep guard againſt one vice, we commonly lye open to the attempts of another.<note place="margin">Acts 10.35.</note> I like not that opinion, which tieth ſalvation to the pale of any Church, leaſt we erre as much in our own, as in another judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: We are commanded not to judg any but our ſelves; and ſaving humility caſts us loweſt, and will make us acknowledge our unworthineſſe, ſo much, as to bring up the rear in Heaven. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is a heavenly and abſolute vertue; the true effect whereof, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Almes more out of obedience to the Almighty, than out of commiſeration on our brother; for his ſake that enjoynes it, rather than for his that asks it. He that relieveth out of bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion only, doth it only for his own ſake, and perhaps becauſe it may be his own caſe, which is a ſiniſter and politick charity: this duty extends into all the wayes of doing good, both to ſoul and body, and by well inſtructing others upon an opportunity of charity, we perform a double duty: to be reſervedly a niggard in this part of goodneſſe, is the moſt ſordid piece of covetouſneſſe, and in ſome ſort more contemptible than pecuniary avarice. No man can juſtly judge another, becauſe no man can juſtly know another, nor truly himſelf: <hi>Adams</hi> faith could not convince himſelf of murther, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Cain</hi> actually ſhewed it upon his brother. A contemplative and ſolitary life, avoideth many common and publike temptations, yet hath the devill ſuch advantage, through our corruption, that if we doe not withall valour and watchfullneſſe, reſiſt both our ſelves and theſe allurements even in our moſt retired thoughts, we ſhall thereby become the moſt abject piece of mortality. Divine dreames are moſt happy entertainments of reſt, thereby the ſleeping of the body may be the waking of the ſoul. Therefore thus</p>

            <p>O my God, I muſt acknowledge and confeſſe, that my heart, my will, my waies, my words and actions, have been evill from my youth: the leproſie of my ſinne is only cureable by the blood of my Saviour, that infinite pledge of thy bleſſed mercy; therefore (O my good God) give me a lively faith to apply it to all my wounds, as thou my God art only good, and from thee only is the will and the deed of true faith and repentance. <hi>Amen</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O my Father, Remember not the ſinnes of my man hood and riper years; I acknowledge (O my God) when I call to minde my breach of promiſes and Covenants both with thee my God and man, which I have ſolemnly made and taken, I have promiſed to thy ſacred Majeſtie my unworthy ſervice (though but the leaſt part of my dutie) upon condition to receive mercy from thee, which in particular thou haſt been gratiouſly pleaſed (as I may judg) to give me, but I (alas) have wholly left undone my promiſe with thee, ſo that ſurely I admire thy patience, that thou haſt not (ere this) caſt me into hell amongſt thy enemies. Thou haſt of thy free mercie given me time of repentance, I truſt thou wilt in thy great goodneſſe, give me true repentance it ſelf, even ſuch as thou wilt not deſpiſe: O give it me for thy mercies ſake.</p>
            <p>O my Creatour, as thou loveſt ſinners in Jeſus, and haſt mercie for the works of thy own hands, give me true and ſaving grace, lead and draw me to thee in true repentance: Lord, thy long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and patience to me, doth give me ſome hope of thy electing me to mercie: O give me the full aſſurance of it, by a true and a lively faith: Open thou (I moſt humbly pray for Chriſt Jeſus his ſake) my dark and cloſed eyes, ſo that I may ſee the wondrous things of thy Law: bleſſe me O my Father, in not imputing ſinne unto me: for man liveth not by bread only, but by every word of thy mouth.</p>
            <p>O God, What is man that thou art mindefull of him,<note place="margin">

Behold thou haſt made my daies as a hand-breadth, and my age as nothing in reſpect of thee, ſurely every man in his beſt eſtate is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vanitie.

Doubtleſſe man walketh in a vain ſhadow, he diſquieteth himſelf in vain, he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who ſhall gather them. And now Lord what wait I for, my hope is even in thee, deliver thou me from all my tranſgreſſions.

               <p>O Almighty and our all-ſufficient Lord God, whoſe will is all things both in Heaven and earth, who art only good, and whoſe mercy endures for ever; to thee the grave is open, and from thee there is no covering for deſtruction; thou ſtetcheſt out the North over the empty place, and hangeſt the earth upon nothing; thou bindeſt thy waters in the clouds, and the clouds are not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken under them; thou holdeſt back the face of thy Throne, and ſpreadeſt the clouds upon it: Thou haſt ſet bounds to the waters, untill the day and night come to an end. The pillars of Heaven tremble and quake at thy reproof, the ſea is calm by thy power, and by thy underſtanding thou ſmiteſt the pride thereof: Thy ſpirit hath garniſhed the Heavens, and thy hand hath formed the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſerpent: Loe theſe are part of thy waies (O mighty God,) but how little a portion have we of thee, and who can underſtand thy fearfull power. Thou art the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, great art thou O Lord and moſt worthy to be praiſed, thy greatneſſe is incomprehenſible: Thou good Lord be mercifull to all us that deſire (or would at leaſt both deſire and fully prepare our whole hearts,) to ſeek and perfectly to ſerve thee the God of our Fathers, although we be not clenſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary. O Lord we beſeech thee let thy loving kindneſſe and thy mercie (to poor miſerable ſinners in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus) direct our hearts, as the hearts of thy elected ſervants, to pray unto thy ſacred Majeſtie, in ſpirit and truth: and we humbly beſeech thee, let thy ears hearken to our praiers, and the praiers of all thy ſervants who deſire to fear thy Name: Two things we moſt humbly beg of thee O our mercy, denie us not them before we die: Remove farre from us vanity and lies; Give us neither poverty nor riches, feed us with food convenient for us, leaſt we be full and denie thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord? or leaſt we be poor and ſteale, and take the Name of our God in vaine; ſo we will praiſe thee O Lord in the power of thy might; ſaying, Thou waſt angry with us becauſe of our mighty ſinnes provoking thee, but

Our ſinnes, O Lord, our ſinnes, they have taken hold of us, that we cannot look up; they are more in number then the hairs of our heads, therefore our hearts have failed us: Let it pleaſe thee O Lord to deliver us, make haſte O God to help us; Our ſouls thirſt for God, even for the living God, when ſhall we come and appear before the preſence of God. O God, thou art our guide for ever, have mercy upon us according to thy loving kindneſſe, according to the multitude of thy mercies doe away our offences: Waſh us throughly from our iniquities, and cleanſe us from our ſinnes, for we know our iniquities, and our ſinnes are ever before us.

Thou O Lord loveſt truth in the heart, therefore give us wiſdome in our inward affections. Purge us with hyſop and we ſhall be clean, waſh us and we ſhall be whiter then ſnow: make us to hear of joy and gladneſſe, that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce: Hide thy face O Lord from our ſinnes, and put away all our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities: Create in us clean hearts O Lord, and renew right ſpirits within us: O caſt us not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy ſpirit from us.

Have mercy upon us, O God, have mercy upon us, for our ſoul truſteth in thee, and in the ſhadow of thy wings will we truſt, till the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of our ſinning againſt thee be overpaſt.

            <l>Which if but rudely known, it's well we ſought:</l>
            <l>We are poor earthy wormes, as plants we grow,</l>

            <l>For they die as their bodies, ſo along,</l>
            <l>We think it's life, not ſoul, which doth keep in</l>
            <l>The vegetative life that is in Plants,</l>

            <l>No whit diminiſht, ſtill it is a crime</l>
            <l>To ſay it's ſhorter: for that cannot be</l>
            <l>When time's worn out, and years thus multiplied,</l>
            <l>It's all one ſtill, it's ſtill eternity,</l>
            <l>Its ſtill as wide a gulf, it's never ſatisfied:</l>

            <l>If time doe end upon us unſuſpected,</l>
            <l>And if it may be ſaid, that without doubt,</l>
            <l>What is moſt needfull, is the moſt neglected:</l>
            <l>Yet in my reaſon I can ſcarce believe,</l>
            <l>But well ſpent dayes, ſhould greater honour have,</l>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96319:91"/>be) a great means, ſign and token of ſalvation: for that afflictions are the cords and ſcourges of the Almighty, to draw and drive us on in the way of ſalvation, they are his ſweet and bleſſed ſurveyors, to purge our ſouls from our bodies pollutions, and make us of a fit alloy for his heavenly Treaſure: they which wound the fleſh and ſad the countenance, make the heart the better: And from the very being engaged under an affliction for life, may be reaped ſweet and joyfull comfort both in life and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore thus:</hi>
               </p>

                  <l>Some ſee the root, yet on it take a fall:</l>
                  <l>Like thoſe that ſee the door, yet puſh the wall,</l>
                  <l>And having fallen upon the rock they ſaw,</l>
                  <l>Receive more good, then though they'd ſcap'd the blow.</l>

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No: we ought hereby ſo to remember our bleſſed Saviour in our time, as we would be remembred by him in our eternity.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But is there ſuch a neceſsity in receiving of it, as if we doe it not, we doe neglect and omit a moſt neceſſary duty to ſalvation, whatſoever the occaſion or reaſon be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No: Our bleſſed God never bindes his ſervants to impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: if lawfull occaſions call and take us from neceſſary oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of receiving it (ſo it be without all neglect or contempt on our part, (it muſt then be onely in our hearts and wills thankfully acknowledged by us: which (in his good mercy) will be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of us for the deed.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> No by no means; for we are onely ſtewards to it, and muſt give an account of it to almighty God who lends it us: whoſe will it is, that we take for our ſelves and families ſuch an under propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, that we may be ſure to have ſufficient relief and charity for the poor diſtreſſed Saints whenſoever we meet with them: that our eſtates may (in ſome ſort at leaſt) be helpfull to their neceſſities: but the laying all upon the preſent and future proviſion for our ſelves and Children, thereby wholly neglecting Charity, is moſt abhominable.</p>

            <p>Q. <hi>Is there any change of that condition in which death ſends us to our eternity?</hi>
            </p>

            <head>A Prayer.</head>
            <p>O Eternall, ever-living, and all-ſufficient Lord God: who art the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, to whom the grave is open, from whom there is no covering for deſtruction: I am thy poor, wretched and unworthy ſervant, and by reaſon of my ſinne, leſſe then the leaſt of all thy mercies, unworthy ſo much as to think upon thee, or to take thy bleſſed Name within my corrupted lips, much more unworthy am I, to have liberty to call upon thy ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and to ask thoſe things that I ſtand in need of, with this gracious aſſurance, that thou wilt give me thoſe things that are beſt for me, though I ask them not of thee, and though I ask them ſo unworthily, that thou maiſt juſtly refuſe to give me them, becauſe I ask them of thee ſo unworthily (ſo that I may with humble bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe pray; Lord give me what is onely beſt for me, though I ask it not: and give me not what is evill for me, though I ask it:) but thou art from everlaſting to everlaſting, holy, and juſt, and good, and thy mercies are above all thy works; wherefore I come unto thee, not in my own merits, but in the merits of thy onely Sonne, my onely Saviour Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, (in whom I believe, Lord help my unbelief,) humbly deſiring thy ſacred Majeſty for his ſake, and for thy own goodneſſe ſake towards the works of thine own hands, to pardon and paſſe by all my ſinnes, actuall and originall, to blot them out of thy book of remembrance, and to ſet them ſo behinde thy back, that thou maiſt never call me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for them, either in this world to my ſhame, or in the world to come to my utter condemnation: Give me grace and ſtrength to return unto thee (O my God) as the prodigall ſonne to his father, acknowledging my ſelf unworthy to be called thy ſonne or ſervant; and give me (I humbly pray) wiſdome, which is about thy throne (for all wiſdome is from thy gracious gift) that ſo I may rightly underſtand earthly things from heavenly things, time from eternity: and graciouſly give me the will and deed, to lay up my treaſure in Heaven, and not on earth: And I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave of thy ſacred goodneſſe, the unreſiſtible power of thy holy Spirit, that thereby I may be built up and made perfect to every good work, to the true and perfect ſerving of thee my good God, and to the working righteouſneſſe, as thy elected Saints (by the powerfull and unreſiſtible guidance of the holy Spirit) doe, and ought to doe, both for and in their time, and their eternity. And (O my good God) becauſe many are the controverſies and diſputes concerning thee, thy word, thy truth, amongſt poor mortality; to the great deſtruction, fear and trouble, of thy poor, willing, and deſiring ſervants; Let thy ſacred Spirit (O my God) ſpeak the truth of thy will (and of my duty) to my conſcience,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96319:96"/>and then give me grace and ſtrength, to follow my conſcience, in the ſacred way of thy holy Spirit, that ſo I may keep a good conſcience towards thee my God, and towards men. And I humbly pray, that thy gracious Spirit may alſo reveale unto my ſoule, what righteouſneſſe, and what unrighteouſneſſe is, what is truth, and what is error; what is the perfect duty of thy ſervant, in all the paſſage of his pilgrimage under the Sunne, and what is not the duty of thy ſervant to doe; that ſo I may not onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto thy ſacred Majeſty, my preſent duty, in thy bleſſed ſervice, but that I may doe it knowingly, willingly and wittingly: and that I may not only avoid all the appearances of evill, but that I may doe it alſo, knowingly, willingly and wittingly, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the moſt faithfull and perfect ſervant of my Creator. O give unto thy ſervant a diſcerning ſpirit; inable him perfectly (O my God) to know good from evill, and then give him grace and ſtrength to doe the good and avoid the evill, as becomes thy moſt bleſſed ſervants. And give unto me thy ſervant (O my good God) a true principle of due obedient love (in all my devotions and undertakings whatſoever) towards thee my good God. And for thy mercies ſake, teach me thy ſtatutes, and hide not thy precepts from me; lead me in the way that I ſhould goe, and hold me in the living path of thy moſt joyfull ſervants. Search my heart (O God) and try my wayes, for there are wayes of iniquity in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting. Let me have, here in this life (O my good God) that, and that only, which may moſt perfect, and fit me in ſoule and body, for thy eternall and moſt ſacred ſervice. Let the daily preſidents of mortality (O my good God) move me to true repentance; give me to know (O my eternall Creator,) that I am no better then my parents, but as they are returned with their bodies to the grave, and their ſouls to thee the God that gave them, ſo it muſt be with me: Give me to know, O Eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that here is no abiding place, here is no continuing dwelling; give me grace and ſtrength (our good God) to ſeek and finde one to come, eternall in the Heavens. Give thy ſervant (O my gracious God) true love to thee my God for thy own ſake, to my neighbour for thy Commandement ſake, and all for obedience ſake unto thy bleſſed Majeſty. Give me to ſee (O thou my only Good) the bleſſed marks of thy ſweet corrections, both upon my body and ſoule, in this life: thoſe glorious impreſſions, by which thou ſealeſt to thy ſelf, thy beloved children, in whom thy ſoul delighteth. O my moſt gracious God, although I be moſt unworthy to be (by thy good grace) accounted ſuch a childe; ſuch delight, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved: yet for, thy own goodneſſe ſake, let thy bleſſed ſeale of thy fatherly impreſſion be upon me, even what thou wilt; for I aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly know, thou wilt (with my moſt needfull ſaving Croſſe) give thy ſervant moſt needfull and ſaving ſtrength to bear it. Give
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96319:97"/>thou (O God) and frame thy ſervant, thankfully to ſee, his yearly gain for his hourly ſervice; his eternall joy, for his temporall grief; the infinite reſt from his finite ſufferings: How fit is it (O my Father) that I ſhould as well ſuffer, as raigne with my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and to know that the preſent afflictions of this life, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the joyes that (in thy moſt free and gracious mercy) ſhall be revealed and given unto me. O my good Father give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me (thy moſt evill deſerving childe,) all thoſe ſweet and bleſſed ſcourges, croſſes and afflictions, even whatſoever is neceſſary and needfull, to frame my imperſect ſoul and body, fit for thy eternall and moſt perfect ſervice. And truly (O my Father) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I were to have of thy juſtice my ſelf-condemning ſentence to all eternity, ſo ſoon as this life is ended; yet my ſerious thoughts, would not make choice to ſpend my time in ſinfull vain delights; but would rather chooſe thy fatherly chaſtiſement and corrections temporall; although they alſo were to be (as I deſerve) eternall: for thy corrections (as all that proceedeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from thee (my God) are ſweete: they ſad the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, thereby making the heart better: I ſubmit wholly to thy will (O my eternall Good,) To be thy ſervant, is my Heaven, for thou art the Lord my God, and I am thine. Thou art the will and the deed, O my God, guide me for thy Names ſake to doe thee ſervice; and in thy goodneſſe accept of my deſire, thy own moſt gracious gift: ſuffer not ſinne (O my Father) to raigne in my corrupted mortall body: let not my ſoul offend my God, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever my body may offend him: let not my will offend my God, however my actions may offend thee, but let the deſires of my ſoul, and the inclinations of my ſpirit, be ſo commanded by thy ſacred power, that they may truly will, and doe thee true and perfect ſervice now and for ever: and doe thou (for thy own mercies ſake to the works of thy own hands, and for the merits of Jeſus Chriſt thy onely Sonne my Saviour,) convert my moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect will, into moſt perfect actions, in thy moſt perfect and everlaſting ſervice: And when theſe dayes of my ſinfull pilgrimage are ended, when I return to thee my God (my hope, my joy,) from this my earthly tabernacle, doe thou (O my bleſſed Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator) re-create my ſoul and body, that ſo thy bleſſed will, may be my eternall perfect joy and comfort; and that to be thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, whereſoever and howſoever, may be the bleſſed Heaven of my ſoul and body for ever. O my Good Eternity, I doe not onely humbly crave theſe mercies, and what is neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (which is the perfect admittance into thy ſacred ſervice) for my ſelf, and ſuch as are near to me in this life; but alſo that it be thy bleſſed will, even for all that thou haſt appointed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, in thy gracious converting of ſinners from the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their waies, that ſo if it be thy bleſſed will (to whom all
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96319:97"/>things are poſſible,) we might be all, as one flock under thee the great and gracious ſhepheard of our ſoules: that ſo the number of thy elect being accompliſhed, the bleſſed reſurrection may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before thee; and we become fit inhabitants for that new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and new earth which thou haſt appointed, and ſinne and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may ceaſe from us thy unworthy ſervants. And further my humble ſuit is, that thou wouldeſt give us to ſee all thy gracious diſpenſations towards us in this life, to know that nothing falls upon us by chance and fortune, but by thy eſpeciall providence and appointment: Give us to know we are not our own, but thine, and that it is moſt right thou ſhouldeſt diſpoſe of thy own for ever: make us to rejoice onely in thy diſpoſe, for that thou art moſt good and gracious, and knoweſt better what is beſt for us than we can know or aske. Now (O my good Creator) take us into thy almighty protection and direction for ever, thou haſt been wonderfull in mercy and goodneſſe to every one of us: thou haſt delivered infinite of us from infinite evils which we ſee others viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, which we may juſtly judge deſerve better at thy hands then we have done: we humbly beſeech thee let this thy mercy lead us to repentance, and make us to love thee as thou haſt loved us, that hath not ſpared thy Son to death for us, that ſo thy juſtice being ſatisfied in his ſufferings for our ſinnes, which could no otherwiſe have beene ſatisfied but in our damnation, thy mercy may be ſufficient for our ſalvation: and although I have provoked thy juſtice by my daily ſinnes to my juſt condemnation, yet doe I caſt my ſoul and body (even for its eternity) upon thy mercy, and doe diſclaime all other judgment then thy gracious pleaſure, in which I will in thy gracious ſtrength, with peace rejoice, and therein reſt for ever. Wherefore to thee O gracious Father, to thee O ſacred Sonne, to thee O eternall Spirit, three perſons but one everlaſting God, be aſcribed as is moſt due, all honour, glory and praiſe, by thy whole creation, now and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
